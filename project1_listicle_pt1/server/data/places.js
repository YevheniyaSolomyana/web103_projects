Even though it may not have beaches like most other Southeast Asian destinations, there are still 4000 Islands, the landscape consists of children's wildest imaginations, and it's home to some of the best beer in Southeast Asia - Beer Lao."

For less than $20, you will be able to explore at least 5 stunning cenotes, like the one in the picture above; for less than $3, you can devour delicious street food like tacos, quesadillas and tortillas; the white sand beaches are essentially free, and the hospitality? Priceless."

        "description": "While the US is generally not a super budget destination, if you are doing a road trip, you can definitely save in some areas and splurge in others to even out your overall budget. Get a national park pass and for $80, you will be able to get a carload of people into any national park in the US for an entire year. Rent a camper van if you are renting a car. Then your accommodation apart from the van fee can be absolutely free by camping only on BLM land."

Any hostels/guesthouse/tourist accommodation in South Africa is called a “backpackers”, and they are typically in beautiful settings and each has a unique personality, not to mention affordable too."
